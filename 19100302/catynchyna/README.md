# 19100302 catynchyna 
Hello, the world.
This is Cat.

# Day0
I got chance ahead to install all required programms and set the environment
from 20190318 to 20190323 

# Day1
Although I got started a week ago when I finally 'see' the tasks assignments documents,
I felt anxious and questioning emotion inside me asking me 'do you really believe you could handle this?'
I answered : not so sure and it's not about whether I believe myself or not it's always about 'Can Cat handle the very scared-you or not...if not, any other plan B to support Cat?'
Plan B: Cat starts to exercise how to handle this and I will support her no matter what!!!
[who's Cat and who am I? you may get confused right? if YOU are curious keep digging my notes:)]

*finally got me MOVED in the github...lalalala*

# Day2 notes:
Cat started her queries on relationships between or among some concepts.
Anaconda.vsCode.Atom.python.github

Even without a clear mind on those concepts Cat could handle to reach the goals -- tackle those tasks. so no reason to panic yet...right? 

Keep digging.

*github fork and conflicted when pull request from Cat's repository submitted. Resolved by Coach@realcaiying*

# Day3 notes:
*It was fun to build this caculator, with my first thought on def not working.*
*Never give up, just tried to google what other people built.*
*Exploring what's within the builder's mind, it was hard but fun.*
**I love this toy.**

- [ ] Stitch Calculator for my Max. LOVE YA!

# Day4 notes:
I was sooooooo trapped in my thoughts.
*What is today's goal?*
My trials and errors really frustrated me for a while.
However, I felt I love this challenge and seeked help to reach the goal.
[THANKS TO CAROL S. DWECK "mindset", got this from SENSEI Joe]
Appreciated for coach and other contributor's kindly support...
Well, I knew I was not alone, yet now I do FEEL I am not alone... 
*heyheyhey trapped cat survived*

# Day5
Cat has been amazed at this camp's tasks design and full of curiosity...

We found one very thing--this camp's 14days trial, with tough and even creepy challenge for us [for now], and we reached agreement to go deeper because we love this game...

Cat pet me and said: we knew this would be hard, so we could try practice harder harderer and hardererer! 

No matter what happened, we knew we love this game we love its challenge and we just have not yet resolved all those issues for now,,, we 'see' those issues and we have our eyes on them, 


# Day6
exploring distinguish control flow from flow control.
use what we learnt from this trial in this camp try answering my curious queries myself.

# Day7
what's real?
what's the dot I have collected?
be patient...
*Cat tried copied and mimicking*

# Day8
wow,,,'seen' others' methods and thoughts
*the vivid world Cat's happily seen*
~started resolving my issue with my mom via patient and continuous communication clearing applied control flow~
~Mom, I now could see we were and would be wired differently and I can communicate with you if I tried your channel and your syntax.I love you Mom!~ 


# Day9 notes:
Confused with my functions defined logic...
Don't panic yet...
Be calm and be patient...
We just have **not yet** figured these parts out...
A long day, do what you have to do and catch up when you have a clearer mind...
*oh, cat trapped in the muddy puddle*


# Day10 notes:
reviewed my codes and exercises work 
tried to debug my coding: int(count) and .most_common([n])
failed over and over and over again...
set a deadline to reorganize my issues and queries to ask for help from others
took a deep breath and kept digging in issues and google and got back to the official docs.
***************this took me 12 pages of draft papers*********************************
well, got you!!!
This bug started from my misunderstanding of list[] attributes...
the variable named 'list' or intended to be assigned an int type value should not be deemed as an int type, [n] meaning you should put a parameter with list type attributes in (), rather than just put your variable into the [].......funny pieces right? but if without this exercise I would not get a chance to see my thoughts and reflected how I reach this usage by overlooking and missing an important concept and relevant definitions.
~~~*buya!yeah!*~~~

# Day11 notes:
Cat wonderred why there were (in campmates' repositories) json files with the same content and formation from day 9 tasks. and could not figured it out so decided to copy and paste and focus on how to finish the tasks assigned that day.

what supported my decision on copying and pasting?

--analogy from our class group : text = 'How The Foolish Old Man Moved Mountains' provided by Coach. issue#1574 submitted my queries and thoughts and got supports from Coach.

Cat really felt "you don't have to know it all to use it...just keeping using it, that may help you get to know it somehow someday."

# Day12 notes:
exploring How to call a function and how to import from a module.
still trapped in my thoughts in basic concepts...
go digging and exploring your curious parts but still rembember you have a goal to reach today.
*Cat is working on day6 array tasks, but not flagged to today's goal*
‘to cure sometimes, to relieve often, to comfort always.’
—Edward Livingston Trudeau
what’s real and comfort for Cat?
do what I have to do...

# Day13 notes:
without the cleared thoughts and still trapped with my confusion about my function logic.
Cat tried to explore more campmates' repositories. and recalled one advice from camp director:
"take your wonders and wondering in the issues section and visit + revisit campmates' basehome"
*Cat exploring issues section and thoughts with execution steps from others*

# Day14 notes:
Final day for this trial in this camp
Not an end…but a milestone..
And a new start, why?
Because we have ‘seen’ the goods of others in this very trial and in this very camp…
Because we can and always will be welcomed to communicate with those ones after this very trial in this very camp :
a)about their goods + 
b)about how we could mimic and practice to use their goods + 
c)to build our good and to accumulate our goods and to welcome others to communicate… 

我想要和大家分享的：
**进取型人格、表现型人格是我们探索的工具**

它们并不是绝对对立的，但是它们是各自独立的，它们有它们各自的特征，它们就是心理上的工具，帮助我们实现我们的目标。

我很多时候会进行不下去一些事情，有客观原因，但如果真诚地面对，我，主观上，尽我所能了么？好像没有，为什么好像，因为不忍面对，为什么不敢面对？因为自己不够“好”，那么什么是“好”？有标尺么？反正我就是不够好了干嘛还要想什么是好，一边去。然后我可能就死机了。

咋一想肯定是表现型人格“作祟”影响了自己去进步。可这次的我感受却不一样，如果不是表现型人格的存在，我感知别人的好不会那么强烈。我不会那么容易的记录下来比较出来的结果。

而这一次，是我们想明白了，我想要什么。
怎么想明白的：
1）之前去拿并拿到加州执照的行动（也不是一开始就想明白一定要，但是最后确信这是自己想要的，行动策略就变化了，学会了求助、获取支持），
2）看了一遍Absorbent Mind(意. MARIA MONTESSORI)（还在看第二遍），反复思考童年的秘密，“every move counts”，every move {inducted by the freewill execution} counts。
3）看了两遍“mindset—how we can learn to fulfill our potential”（美.CAROL S. DWECK, Ph.D），那些面对挑战充满了兴趣的孩子们，为什么？为了什么？怎么会这样？我有可能么？怎么做到？

我们的结论：我想要探索的工作就是最好的工作。那么既然是我想要的，掌握方法去帮助探索即使很难，也充满了愉悦，因为这意味着我有了工具能更好的探索，这不值得跃跃欲试么？

**我们的Python训练营探索生活**
在这次Python训练营的尝试中，反思(Cat me 负责反思和总结加执行,tough guy！scared me，bold me，funny me，jealous me，nuts me，angry me，sad me，anxious me，happy me，and so on ， we have lots of mess。。。)我们怎么走的，收获了什么：

1. *看到别人的好*
Input:
I1去看 ##move
I2尽量多的去看
I3尽量从这么多里面找到感兴趣的使劲看

Process:
P1看的同时想“什么是好” ##move
P2在自己感兴趣的那部分使劲想”为什么就是好”
P3看的这么多里面哪个或者哪些是“最好”
P4看得见自己可以模仿的方法了么？
P5能不能试试？能，转到output
While P5 不能？
##reason：那没看见，不是真在“想”
##solution：回到P1看的同时想。。。真想。。。
##如何检验是否“真”想了：使用output

Output:
O1用纸笔记录怎么进行的I1去看
O2用纸笔记录P1“什么是好”思考的过程与疑问
O3用纸笔记录P2自己感兴趣的部分人家”为什么就是好”的比较理由与列表
O4用纸笔记录P3自己的思考选择以及理由和疑惑
O5我能怎么用这个“好”？
O6我“真”能用这个好的痕迹，运用的每一个点滴
O7这些点滴，我还能用在哪儿呢？
O8记录自己把握的点滴，看到自己的“好”
O9把自己的“好”真实的运用起来，让别人感受到


2. *求助*：
communication意味着什么？
看见的最快物理接近好的方法论。
这也是自己*练、做得不够的地方*：
把握自己的点滴的时候，还是会去因为别人积累的不同而嫉妒，比较的范畴不清晰：
要看到别人的好，别人这部分展现出来的积累就是ta的好，看见甚至说看了人家的积累过程就是我的收获：

因为班里各位同学的认真讨论、分享，我反复读了多遍群内记录，自己好像没有get到他们那么多的收获，有点沮丧，但是，Cat在脑海里马上执行了检验程序：
我们的收获是什么？
我们真的没有那么“多”收获么？
我们要回答上述两个问题必须先回顾：
我们的记录
我们把握的点滴真存在
我们很开心我们看到了别人的好
我们很开心我们有机会看到自己可以用的好
我们很开心大家都有自己的收获

同时，因为班里同学们的热忱与朝气蓬勃，自己收到了很多的鼓励。

不要怕的方法论：
真。点滴。看到别人的好。与好物理接近。

3. *致谢*
最想感谢Cat, Cat成功的迈开了步子，因为every move counts的信念来源于Cat在此之前迈出去的步子们。。。Cat持续地帮助调整注意力集中到把握我们能把握的点滴上。。。所以。。。不要怕，需要有个方法还需要专门由谁来负责执行，Cat的这个方法也是抄的@核聚（wechat id：hejupai）的“真”与“把握点滴”。

感谢互联网让我们能看的更多。

感谢互联网上、生活中乐于分享的所有人，让我们的世界充满了美好。

Cat有幸生活在这个世界，一路上获得了那么多的人的帮助与支持，遇到了李笑来老师，通过笑来老师的眼睛，通过笑来老师的方法与提供的支持，看到了许岑、张旎、mj、老猫、邱老板、和菜头等等老师们的好。有幸遇到了mentor孙志勇老师，他的耐心指导与无条件支持让Cat有机会成长，有机会看到更多的好。

感谢我的家人，especially Alucard and Max. 你们包容与支持了各种缺陷的我，陪伴我一起成长。

感谢这个训练营的每一位成员，有你们，真好。

Nonstop the beat！
