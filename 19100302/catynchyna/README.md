Hello, the world.
This is Cat.

# Day3 notes:
*It was fun to build this caculator, with my first thought on def not working.*
*Never give up, just tried to google what other people built.*
*Exploring what's within the builder's mind, it was hard but fun.*
**I love this toy.**

- [ ] Stitch Calculator for my Max. LOVE YA!

# Day4 notes:
I was sooooooo trapped in my thoughts.
*What is today's goal?*
My trials and errors really frustrated me for a while.
However, I felt I love this challenge and seeked help to reach the goal.
[THANKS TO CAROL S. DWECK "mindset", got this from SENSEI Joe]

Well, I knew I was not alone, yet now I do FEEL I am not alone...

# Day9 notes:
Confused with my functions defined logic...
Don't panic yet...
Be calm and be patient...
We just have **not yet** figured these parts out...
A long day, do what you have to do and catch up when you have a clearer mind...
*oh, cat trapped in the muddy puddle*
