# Day3 notes:
*It was fun to build this caculator, with my first thought on def not working.*
*Never give up, just tried to google what other people built.*
*Exploring what's within the builder's mind, it was hard but fun.*
**I love this toy.**

# Day4 notes:
I was sooooooo trapped in my thoughts.
*What is today's goal?*
My trials and errors really frustrated me for a while.
However, I felt I love this challenge and seeked help to reach the goal.
