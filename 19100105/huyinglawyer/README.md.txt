Yesterday, I spent a lot of effort. Under the careful guidance of the counselors and coaches, I completed 90% of the first day of work. I would like to thank the counselor for the most in the process. Is the "submission" link, if the button that encounters "submit" is grayed out (if the button can be submitted, the button should be black), you can consider whether your file is a new file (the content can be modified) That is, if the submitted file is not new or has no modifications, it is usually not possible to submit.Of course, I have encountered other problems, but they have all been solved.
