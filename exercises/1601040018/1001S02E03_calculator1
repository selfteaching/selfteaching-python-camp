Below is a simple calculation which can perform adding,substracting,multipling,dividing from the two numbers entered by user
Firstly create functions for opertations
def add(x,y):
    return x+y
def substract (x,y)
    return x-y
def multiple (x,y)
    return x*y
def divide (x,y)
    return x/y
  
Then build the blocks for user to provide inputs
print("please type in 2 nums you would like to use for calculation.")
num1 = float(input("Enter your first mumber:"))
num2 = float(input("Enter your second number:"))
a = num1
b = num2
print("please select the operatin (A/B/C/D) you would like to perform from below list.")
print(A. add\nB. substract\nC. multiple\D. divide")
choice = input("Enter your choice of operation:")

Lastly process the input from user to do the corresponding calculation
if choice == "A":
   print(a,"plus" b,"equal to",add(a,b))
elif choice == "B"
   print(a,"minus"b,"equal to",substract(a,b))
elif choice == "C"
   print(a,"multipleb,"equal to",multiple(a,b))
elif choice == "D"
   print(a,"divide"b,"equal to",divide(a,b))
else:
   print("There'\s somethig wrong with your inputs,please try again.")
