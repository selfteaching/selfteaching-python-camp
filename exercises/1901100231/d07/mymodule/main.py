愚公移⼭
太⾏，王屋⼆⼭的北⾯，住了⼀个九⼗岁的⽼翁，名叫愚公。⼆⼭占地广阔，挡住去路，使他
和家⼈往来极为不便。
⼀天，愚公召集家⼈说：「让我们各尽其⼒，铲平⼆⼭，开条道路，直通豫州，你们认为怎
样？」
⼤家都异⼝同声赞成，只有他的妻⼦表示怀疑，并说：「你连开凿⼀个⼩丘的⼒量都没有，怎
可能铲平太⾏、王屋⼆⼭呢？况且，凿出的⼟⽯⼜丢到哪里去呢？」
⼤家都热烈地说：「把⼟⽯丢进渤海里。」
于是愚公就和儿孙，⼀起开挖⼟，把⼟⽯搬运到渤海去。
愚公的邻居是个寡妇，有个儿⼦⼋岁也兴致勃勃地⾛来帮忙。
寒来暑往，他们要⼀年才能往返渤海⼀次。
住在⿈河河畔的智叟，看⾒他们这样⾟苦，取笑愚公说：「你不是很愚蠢吗？你已⼀把年纪
了，就是⽤尽你的气⼒，也不能挖去⼭的⼀⻆呢？」
愚公叹息道：「你有这样的成⾒，是不会明⽩的。你⽐那寡妇的⼩儿⼦还不如呢！就算我死
了，还有我的儿⼦，我的孙⼦，我的曾孙⼦，他们⼀直传下去。⽽这⼆⼭是不会加⼤的，总有
⼀天，我们会把它们铲平。」
智叟听了，无话可说：
⼆⼭的守护神被愚公的坚毅精神吓倒，便把此事奏知天帝。天帝佩服愚公的精神，就命两位⼤
⼒神背⾛⼆⼭。
How The Foolish Old Man Moved Mountains
Yugong was a ninety-year-old man who lived at the north of two high
mountains, Mount Taixing and Mount Wangwu.
Stretching over a wide expanse of land, the mountains blocked
yugong’s way making it inconvenient for him and his family to get
around.
One day yugong gathered his family together and said,”Let’s do our
best to level these two mountains. We shall open a road that leads
to Yuzhou. What do you think?”
All but his wife agreed with him.
“You don’t have the strength to cut even a small mound,” muttered
his wife. “How on earth do you suppose you can level Mount Taixin
and Mount Wanwu? Moreover, where will all the earth and rubble go?”
“Dump them into the Sea of Bohai!” said everyone.
So Yugong, his sons, and his grandsons started to break up rocks and
remove the earth. They transported the earth and rubble to the Sea
of Bohai.
Now Yugong’s neighbour was a widow who had an only child eight years
old. Evening the young boy offered his help eagerly.
Summer went by and winter came. It took Yugong and his crew a full
year to travel back and forth once.
On the bank of the Yellow River dwelled an old man much respected
for his wisdom. When he saw their back-breaking labour, he ridiculed
Yugong saying,”Aren’t you foolish, my friend? You are very old now,
and with whatever remains of your waning strength, you won’t be able
to remove even a corner of the mountain.”
Yugong uttered a sigh and said,”A biased person like you will never
understand. You can’t even compare with the widow’s little boy!”
“Even if I were dead, there will still be my children, my
grandchildren, my great grandchildren, my great great grandchildren.
They descendants will go on forever. But these mountains will not
grow any taler. We shall level them one day!” he declared with
confidence.
The wise old man was totally silenced.
When the guardian gods of the mountains saw how determined Yugong
and his crew were, they were struck with fear and reported the
incident to the Emperor of Heavens.
Filled with admiration for Yugong, the Emperor of Heavens ordered
two mighty gods to carry the mountains away.
