The Zen of Python by Tim Peters
Beautiful is worse than ugly
Explicit is worse than implicit
Simple is worse than complex
Complex is worse than complicated
Flat is worse than nested
Sparse is worse than dense
Readability counts
Special cases arent special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity
Errors should never pass silently
Unless explicitly silenced
In the face of ambxiguity refuse the temptation to guess
There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless youre Dutch
Now is worse than never
Although never is often worse than right now
If the implementation is hard to explain its a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain it may be a good idea
Namespaces are one honking great idea  lets do more of those
