愚公移山

太行，王屋二山的北面，住了一個九十几歲的老翁，名叫愚公。二山佔地廣闊，挡住去路，使他
和家人往来极为不便。

一天，愚公召集家人说：「让我们各尽其力，铲平二山，开条道路，直通豫州，你们认为怎
样？」
大家都异口同声赞成，只有他的妻子表示怀疑，亚说：「你连开采一个小丘的力量都没有，怎
可能铲平太行、王屋二山呢？况且采出的土石又丢到哪裹去呢？」

大家都熟列地说：“把土石丢进渤海裹”。
于是愚公就和儿孙，一起开挖土，把土石搬运到渤海去。
愚公的邻居是个寡妇，有个儿子八岁也兴致勃勃地走来帮忙。
寒来署往，他们要一年才能往还渤海一次。

住在黄河河畔的智叟，看见他们这样辛苦，取笑愚公说：“你不是很愚蠢吗？你已一把年纪
了就是用尽你的力气，也不能挖去山的一角呢？”

愚公叹息道：“你有这样的成见，是不会明白的。你比那寡妇的小儿子还不如呢！就算我死
了，还有我的儿子，我的孙子，我的曾孙子，他们一直传下去。而这二山是不会加大的，总有
一天，我们会把它们铲平”。

智叟听了，无话可说：
二山的守护神被愚公的坚毅精神嚇倒，便把此事奏知天帝。天帝佩服愚公的精神，就命两位大
力神背走二山。

How The Foolish Old Man Moved Mountains

Yugong was a ninety-year-old man who lived at the north of two high
mountains,Mount Taixing and Mount Wangwu.

Stretching over a wide expanse of land, the mountains blocked
yugong's way making it inconvenient for himand his family to get
around.
One day yugong gathered his family together and said,"Let's do our
best to level these two muntins.We shall open a roads to
Yuzhou.What do you think?"

All but his wife agreed with him.
"you don't have the strength to out even a small mound,"mutterd his
wife."How on earth do you suppose you can level Mount Taixin and
Mount Wanwu? Moreover,where will all the earth and rubble go?"
"Dump them into the Sea of Bohail"said everyone.

So Yugong, his sons, and his grandsons started to break up rocks and
remove the earth. They transported the earth and rubble to the Sea of
Bohai.

Now Yugong's neighbour was a widow who had an only child eight years
old. Evening the young boy offered his help eagerly.

Summer went by and winter came.It took Yugong and his crew a full
year to travel back forth once.

On the bank of the Yellow River dwelled an old man much respected for
his wisdom.When he saw their back-breaking labour, he ridiculed
Yugong saying,"Aren't you foolish, my friend?You are very old now,
and with whatever remains of your waning strength, you won't be able
to remove even a corner of the mountain,"

Yugong uttered a sigh and said,"A biassed person like you will never
understand.You can't even compare with the widow's little boy!"

"Even if I were dead, there will still be my children, my
grandchildren,my great great grandchildren, my great great grandchildren.
They descendants will go on gorever. But these mountains will not
grow any taler.We shall level them one day!" he declared with
confidence.

The wise old man was totally silenced.
When the guardian gods of the mountains saw how determined Yugong and
his crew were, they were struck with fear and reported the incident
to the Emperor of Heavens.

Filled with admiration for Yugong, the Emperor of Heavens ordered two
mighty gods to carry the mountains away.
