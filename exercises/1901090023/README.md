## Day14  对自学的感悟和理解

这两个月报名参加“Python编程入门自学训练营”，和来自各行各业的十多名童鞋一起自学。面对一个完全陌生的领域，从不知所措、自我怀疑到一步步走出重重迷雾，完成爬虫语言编程入门的任务。在自学路上，一枚编程小白到底经历了什么？又收获了什么？

### 1. 自学是什么样的旅程？

* 在Python任务自学中，不断经历笨手笨脚、手忙脚乱，问各种当时绞尽脑汁也想不明白的傻乎乎的问题。看到其他学员也一样，我明白了我所经历的很可能是入门新领域的必经过程。

* In the self-teaching course of recent tasks, I constantly ran into a state of clumsiness and anxiety, and asked silly questions that no matter how I racked my brain yet still remained confused about at that moment. After learning this was the same case in other learners, I realized what I encountered was probably the must-experience process on the threshold of entering a new field.

 

* 不会做、做不好，有挫败感、痛苦和自我怀疑，但不要随便放弃，调整好心态后，再接着做下去；做不到很懂，先弄懂一小部分，先去完成任务，先尝试把完成任务需要的知识点搞懂。

* I don’t know what to do; I cannot do it well; I am disappointed, miserable and self-doubted. Yes, my feelings are true. But do not run away just because of these! First, do something to be calm and rational again, then go on to do the tasks. Despite the fact that I cannot understand all the reference material, I could attempt to master a bit of it, bit by bit. Try to finish the tasks first, as well as understand the points required in the completion of tasks.

 

* 记起Elly说过的，要对自己无条件的爱和耐心。我经历的再正常不过，关键是掌握好的学习方法，早点度过这个过程。

* Elly once said, treat yourself with unconditional love and patience, for my experiences are not uncommon at all. The key is to gain more effective self-teaching approaches and going through the process as soon as possible. 

 

> **总结：那些“看不懂、不知所措、似乎明白了，这怎么办”等等，是常态。明白了“自学就是不断动脑，逼迫自己去思考下一步怎么办，要怎么做才能有效解决眼前的问题。” **

**Conclusion**: It is not uncommon at all that “I don’t understand”, “I have no idea”,“I seem to understand”, “how to deal with this?” and the like. I come to realize that “self-teaching involves using my brain constantly, propelling myself to come up with the next step and the effective solutions to the questions ahead.”

### 2. 自学会经历哪些心态？

* 整个过程中（尤其是Day4-6的自学任务），经常有“看不懂，没有解答思路”的情况，所以常常蹦出“放着好好的日子不过，跑这里找虐”的想法。此时，我就提醒自己，我是来了解编程到底是怎么回事的，我是来提高自学能力的。一遍遍告诉自己，要耐心，要沉住气。

* In the process(especially for Day4-6 tasks), I frequently encountered the situations like “What? I totally don’t understand!”, “I have no idea about how to solve this!”. Thus, the idea that I choose to suffer rather than live a cozy life often occurred to me. Then, I reminded myself that I do this for getting to know what programming is like, and for enhancing my ability in self-teaching. Again and again, I told myself to keep patient and stay calm.

 

* 有时任务就卡在那里，绞尽脑汁也不得要领，在最绝望的时候，我想到了教练，想到了其他童鞋。于是在issue区提问求助，得到了童鞋和教练的提示和鼓励。此时，才蓦地惊醒，“要给解决任务设置时限，必要时果断求助”，这才解了燃眉之急。

* Sometimes I was stuck on a particular task, racking my brain but gaining nothing. When huge despair crawled, I thought of my coach and other learners, so I turned to them in the “issue area”, a special online zone for all learners to post their problems in learning, and got their clues and encouragement. Only then did I realize that I should ask for help immediately if it takes so long to cope with a problem, which finally helped me in handling the paper tiger.

 

* 在自学过程中，当发现自己这也不会、那也不会时，如果着急焦虑，那么即使任务最终完成了，也会觉得非常疲惫，甚至痛苦。相反，此时放松而专注地去自学，那么完成任务后仍然会觉得精力旺盛，并且开心满满。

* In the self-teaching process, if you are anxious when you find you do not understand this or that, then you will probably feel exhausted and even miserable even though you finish all tasks. Conversely, if you choose to be relaxed and focused then, you are likely to stay energetic and cheerful the moment you complete the assignments.

 

> **总结：只要有耐心，一步步想办法，我相信我们能搞得定。毕竟，最后很多人做到了，不是吗？**

**Conclusion**: As long as we have patience to address the problems step by step, I believe that we can make it. After all, many learners did it finally, didn’t they?

### 3.自学有什么好方法？

* 从刚拿到任务到最终完成任务，需要沉下心去阅读参考资料，耐心去找跟任务关联的信息点和解决思路，不对的地方再定位问题，这样一步步下来，终于一点点拨开云雾见青天。

* From receiving the tasks to accomplishing them, you need to calm down while reading reference material, find out relevant information and solutions to the task with patience, pinpoint problems when anything goes wrong. By following these steps, you will finally get things done.  

 

* 接受自己在自学过程中做不好非常非常重要！零基础学员做任务各种不顺利——本该如此啊！既然如此，入门新领域，我们首先必须明白，没有人一上来就做得很好，根本不必跟人比较，更不必因此自卑。所以，入门新领域学习方法之一就是完成一个任务，不给自己限时。

* It is critical to accept the fact that I cannot do it well in the process! A beginner cannot finish a task smoothly—it should be like this! Thus, when we start to learn a new skill, we need to understand at first that nobody could do so well just at the very beginning. We do not need to compare with others, nor do we degrade ourselves if we are terrible with a new skill. In this sense, a good way to learn is to not set a limited time period for us to complete a certain task.

 

* 在自学训练营，练成了使用Google搜索的习惯。不得不说，这真是解决问题的极好办法，哪里不会google哪里。

* In the self-teaching camp, it is nice to form a habit of using Google, a powerful searching tool. There is no doubt that it is a fantastic approach to solve a problem: google wherever you do not understand.

 

* 自学一个新领域，最好跟社群一起学。在群里看到自己跟各位小伙伴有共同目标、共同体验，是自己得以一步步走到最终胜利的重要原因。而单打独斗，往往难以走下去。人是群居动物，人就是乐于与志同道合的人一起。

* To self-teach in a brand-new field, we had better do it in a community. Seeing I and other members have the same goal and experience is the key to attempting to the final success. On the other hand, it is rather difficult for us to go alone on the way to self-learning. In other words, humans are “people creatures” who prefer to work with the same type of people.  

 

* 自学要有反馈，有专业人士指导，这样才能及时了解自己的情况，比如自己做得怎么样，怎么解决某些具体任务，或完成的任务有哪些出现问题，又该如何改正。

* We need feedback when self-learning. With the instructions of professionals, we are able to learn how well we have done, how to handle some concrete tasks or how to debug the mistakes we have made.

 

#### 总结：非常感谢训练营的教练们，感谢他们设计的Python自学产品，让我的自学能力得以提高，我不会忘记这段自学体验，今后我要尽力把自学能力发扬光大。再次感谢！
