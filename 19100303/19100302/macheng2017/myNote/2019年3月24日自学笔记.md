#### 1. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. 

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.


用了两年的github 到现在才明白,master主分支仓库是用来和别人同步用的,别人开发包括自己开发要用其他分支,这样才不会因为别人的提交而影响到自己的更改(master是主干,其他成员包括自己都是分支;是不能直接提交到master分支的,每个人提交修改后统一由仓库管理者合并到主干当中)当然自己一直都是一个人提交commit,我一直使用的是单机版的github

#### 一些概念

repositories
> 1.通常被用来组织(存放)一个单一项目
> 2.可以包含,文件夹,文件,图片,视频,电子表格,数据集,或者任何你项目需要的东西
> 3.推荐包含一个READE, 许可文件


branches
   > 1. Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
   > 2. use branches to experiment and make edits 
   > 3. saved different versions 
   > 4. use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. 


  
commits   
 >On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.
 >Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Pull Requests
>Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 






#### issues

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.


GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

GitHub’s issue tracking is special because of our focus on collaboration, references, and excellent text formatting.
