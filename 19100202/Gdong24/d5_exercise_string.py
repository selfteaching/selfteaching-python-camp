    Errors should never pass silently.\
    Unless explicitly silenced.\
    In the face of ambxiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\
    Now is better than never.\
    Although never is often better than *right* now.\
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!'ï¼‰"
