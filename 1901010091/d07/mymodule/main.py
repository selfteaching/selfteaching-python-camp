日前，美国一名有头有脸的高官，对英国向中国电信设备制造商华为公司开放部分5G网络的想法发出“警告”，
污称此举可能让中国“控制未来的互联网”，并“用比特和字节来分化西方联盟”。最近，美国又执意把华为列
为“不确定实体”，竭力进行打压。
一段时间以来，一些美国官员不辞辛苦，在世界各地奔忙，四处兜售“中国技术有害论”，对源自中国科技人
员的所有发明创造都有一种偏执狂的敌视，不断给人扣上各种各样的屎盆子。但是，人间自有公道在，世人
都知道，不论有些人怎么扣屎盆子，香者自香，臭者自臭。
抛出“中国技术有害论”，是美国一些人对中国科技发展的莫名嫉妒，也是一种政治打压的借口，兼具技术恐
吓色彩和政治恐吓色彩，但政治企图是其主要动机，迟滞中国前进的步伐是其真实用心。
德国专利数据库公司IPlytics的数据显示，截至今年3月，5G通信所需的标准必要专利申请数量中，中国
占有34.02%的比例，而美国的份额仅为14%。这正是一些美国人所担心的。美国官员赤裸裸地宣称“5G是一
场美国只能赢的零和军备大赛”，“要确保5G网络不被敌人掌握”，显示其已将“冷战思维”扩散到科技领域，
企图用封闭小圈子捆绑世界科技发展。这是逆时代潮流而动！靠不实之词到处混淆视听、招摇撞骗，靠政治
打压阻碍他国科技进步，只能让世人看清其险恶心理和狰狞面目。
How The Foolish Old Man Moved Mountains
Yugong was a ninety-year-old man who lived at the north of two high
mountains, Mount Taixing and Mount Wangwu.
Stretching over a wide expanse of land, the mountains blocked
yugong’s way making it inconvenient for him and his family to get
around.
One day yugong gathered his family together and said,”Let’s do our
best to level these two mountains. We shall open a road that leads to
Yuzhou. What do you think?”
All but his wife agreed with him.
“You don’t have the strength to cut even a small mound,” muttered his
wife. “How on earth do you suppose you can level Mount Taixin and
Mount Wanwu? Moreover, where will all the earth and rubble go?”
“Dump them into the Sea of Bohai!” said everyone.
So Yugong, his sons, and his grandsons started to break up rocks and
remove the earth. They transported the earth and rubble to the Sea of
Bohai.
Now Yugong’s neighbour was a widow who had an only child eight years
old. Evening the young boy offered his help eagerly.
Summer went by and winter came. It took Yugong and his crew a full
year to travel back and forth once.
On the bank of the Yellow River dwelled an old man much respected for
his wisdom. When he saw their back-breaking labour, he ridiculed
Yugong saying,”Aren’t you foolish, my friend? You are very old now,
and with whatever remains of your waning strength, you won’t be able
to remove even a corner of the mountain.”
Yugong uttered a sigh and said,”A biased person like you will never
understand. You can’t even compare with the widow’s little boy!”
“Even if I were dead, there will still be my children, my
grandchildren, my great grandchildren, my great great grandchildren.
They descendants will go on forever. But these mountains will not
grow any taler. We shall level them one day!” he declared with
confidence.
The wise old man was totally silenced.
When the guardian gods of the mountains saw how determined Yugong and
his crew were, they were struck with fear and reported the incident
to the Emperor of Heavens.
Filled with admiration for Yugong, the Emperor of Heavens ordered two
mighty gods to carry the mountains away.
